# @luxass/pi-voice

Record speech and paste the transcription into [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono)'s composer.

## Install

```sh
pi install npm:@luxass/pi-voice
```

Recording requires `sox` on your `PATH`. Run `/voice setup` to choose a local or API transcription profile and an input device. Local transcription also needs `whisper-cli`; the model picker can download a Whisper model. API transcription does not require a local Whisper installation. Setup reports any remaining requirements without installing system packages.

## Use

Press **Ctrl+Shift+V** or run `/voice` to start recording. Requirements are checked before the microphone starts. If something is missing, Voice explains it and offers to open setup. Completing setup does not start recording; press the shortcut or run `/voice` again when you are ready. Press it again to stop, transcribe, and paste the result into the composer. The extension does not send your message for you.

| Command                | Purpose                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/voice`               | Start or stop recording and transcribe on stop.      |
| `/voice cancel`        | Discard the current recording.                       |
| `/voice setup`         | Choose a profile and input, then check requirements. |
| `/voice device`        | Choose an input device or the system default.        |
| `/voice profile add`   | Create a local or API transcription profile.         |
| `/voice profile`       | Switch between saved profiles.                       |
| `/voice profile model` | Change the active profile's model.                   |
| `/voice status`        | Show the current profile and input device.           |
| `/voice doctor`        | Check recording and transcription setup.             |

Without saved settings, Voice offers setup. A local profile without an explicit model uses the first model in `~/.cache/whisper`. Set `AGENT_VOICE_MODEL_DIR` to keep models elsewhere; downloads and discovery both use it. For API transcription, `/voice profile add` asks for the endpoint, model, request format, and **name of an environment variable** holding the API key. Keep the key in your environment, not in the settings file.

Settings are loaded once at boot from Pi's agent directory, using `voice-settings.json`. Set `AGENT_VOICE_SETTINGS` to use a different file. TypeBox validates known fields, while extra keys are accepted without warnings. If the file is missing, Voice shows a setup hint. If it cannot be loaded or validated, Voice shows the errors and keeps `/voice setup` available. Loading never rewrites the file. Setup saves a complete configuration and updates it in memory; manual file edits require `/reload`. A recording keeps the profile it started with.
