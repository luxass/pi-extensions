# Contributing

Use Node.js 24 and the pnpm version pinned in `package.json`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
```

## Checks and fixes

Run these commands from the repository root:

| Command          | Purpose                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Check root tooling configs and every workspace package with TypeScript.  |
| `pnpm lint`      | Run type-aware Oxlint checks. Warnings fail the command.                 |
| `pnpm lint:fix`  | Apply safe lint fixes, then report remaining issues.                     |
| `pnpm fmt`       | Format files and sort imports with Oxfmt.                                |
| `pnpm fmt:check` | Check formatting without writing files.                                  |
| `pnpm check`     | Run lint, formatting checks, typechecking, and the current test command. |

Every package also exposes `typecheck`, `lint`, `lint:fix`, `fmt`, and `fmt:check`. Run them inside the package or use a filter:

```sh
pnpm --filter @luxass/pi-btw typecheck
pnpm --filter @luxass/pi-voice lint
```

CI runs the same root lint, formatting, and typecheck commands. Checks do not fix files automatically.

## Configuration ownership

- `tsconfig.base.json` owns shared compiler settings.
- Root `tsconfig.json` checks `*.config.ts` tooling files.
- Each package's `tsconfig.json` extends the base and includes `src/**/*.ts` and `tests/**/*.ts`.
- `oxlint.config.ts` owns lint rules for the whole repository, including package-local commands. Oxlint uses type information but leaves compiler diagnostics to `tsc`.
- `oxfmt.config.ts` owns formatting and import sorting. Do not add competing formatting rules to Oxlint.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalogs pin tool and Pi versions.

Extensions publish TypeScript source, without a build step. The shared compiler settings use `Preserve` modules and `Bundler` resolution for Pi's TypeScript loader. Node types are explicit, and the standard library targets ES2023 to include non-mutating array APIs supported by Node.js 24, without assuming a browser environment.

Keep `strict`, unchecked-index checks, override checks, and unused-code checks enabled. Unused callback parameters can use an underscore prefix. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is not enabled yet; adopting it needs a separate review of optional fields and dependency types.

Prefer fixing a lint finding. When a suppression is necessary, keep it local and explain why. Unused lint suppressions fail checks. New safety rules should be explicit rather than enabling the entire pedantic category.

## Adding an extension

Create a package under `packages/` with a `package.json`, `src/`, and this `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "tests/**/*.ts"]
}
```

Use the same scripts as existing packages:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "fmt": "oxfmt .",
    "fmt:check": "oxfmt --check .",
    "lint": "oxlint --deny-warnings .",
    "lint:fix": "oxlint --fix --deny-warnings .",
    "typecheck": "tsc -p tsconfig.json"
  }
}
```

Keep the published `files` list limited to source and package documentation. Tests belong in `tests/`, outside published `src/`. Declare Pi entry points under `pi.extensions` and runtime dependencies in the package manifest.

Root typechecking executes `tsc` in every workspace package directly. A missing package typecheck script cannot silently skip the package, and a missing `tsconfig.json` fails the check.

## Tests

Don't write tests!
